  List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
  
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
  
  If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
  
  
  ## License
  
  The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

  🏆 The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
  
  ## Badges
  
  ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)
  
  Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  
  ## Features
  
  If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.
  
  
  ## Contributing
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.`
